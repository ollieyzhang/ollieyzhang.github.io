I am a 2nd-year PhD student at EPFL and also working as a research assistant in the [Robot Learning & Interaction](https://www.idiap.ch/en/scientific-research/robot-learning-and-interaction) group at [Idiap Research Institute](https://www.idiap.ch/en), supervised by [Dr. Sylvain Calinon](https://calinon.ch/index.htm) and [Prof. Colin Jones](https://people.epfl.ch/colin.jones). 

I am targeting on building intelligent robot assistants living together with humans at home. 

I am currently working on **integrating task and motion planning with robot learning for long-horizon manipulation tasks**. 

My research interest includes **robot learning, task and motion planning, and graph representation**. 

My previous research experiences cover **imitation learning**, **deep reinforcement learning**, **Sim2Real transfer**, **variable impedacne control**, **robot manipulators and quadrupled robots**

Feel free to contact me for any collaboration.
