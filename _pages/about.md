I am a 2nd-year PhD student at EPFL and also working as a research assistant in the [Robot Learning & Interaction](https://www.idiap.ch/en/scientific-research/robot-learning-and-interaction) group at [Idiap](https://www.idiap.ch/en), supervised by [Dr. Sylvain Calinon](https://calinon.ch/index.htm) and [Prof. Colin Jones](https://people.epfl.ch/colin.jones). 

![Research goals](/images/kitchen_robot.png){: .align-right width="180px"}

I am targeting on building intelligent robot assistants living together with humans at home. I am currently working on integrating task and motion planning with robot learning for long-horizon manipulation tasks. My research interest includes **robot learning**, **task and motion planning**, and **graph theory**. My previous research experiences cover imitation learning, deep reinforcement learning, sim2real transfer, variable impedacne control, robot manipulators and legged robots. See [Projects](https://ollieyzhang.github.io/projects/) for more details.

Occasionally, I will share some master thesis project proposals for master students at EPFL or anyone interested in them. Please refer to [Teaching](https://ollieyzhang.github.io/projects/) for more information. 

I am also glad to discuss with anyone for any potential collaboration. Feel free to contact me!
