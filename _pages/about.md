I am a 2nd-year PhD student at EPFL. I am also working as a research assistant in the [Robot Learning & Interaction](https://www.idiap.ch/en/scientific-research/robot-learning-and-interaction) group at [Idiap](https://www.idiap.ch/en). I am supervised by [Dr. Sylvain Calinon](https://calinon.ch/index.htm) and [Prof. Colin Jones](https://people.epfl.ch/colin.jones). 

![Research goals](/images/kitchen_robot.png){: .align-right width="180px"}

I am targeting on building intelligent robot assistants living together with humans at home. I am currently working on integrating task and motion planning with robot learning for long-horizon manipulation tasks. My research interest includes **robot learning**, **task and motion planning**, and **graph theory**. My previous research experiences cover imitation learning, deep reinforcement learning, Sim2Real transfer, variable impedacne control, robot manipulators and quadrupled robots. 

Feel free to contact me for any collaboration.
