Teaching and project supervision are within [Robot Learning and Interaction](https://www.idiap.ch/en/scientific-research/robot-learning-and-interaction) group, led by [Dr. Sylvain Calinon](https://calinon.ch/index.html). Please check also his [website](https://calinon.ch/projProp.htm) for potential interesting projects supervised by other group members.

# Open Projects:

Currently none. 

Contact me or [Dr. Sylvain Calinon](https://calinon.ch/index.html) if you would like to propose one.

<!-- # Undergoing Projects:
## [Real2Sim Environment Modeling for Household Robot in Kitchen Environments](https://sites.google.com/view/logic-lfd/)

<div style="text-align:justify;">
An accurate simulation models that are physically realistic plays an important roles in robotics. This project aims to build a simulation model of the kitchen environment in a real-to-sim pipeline. Recent work (e.g. <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.11656">[1]</a>) show that the URDF model of an articulated environment can be reconstructed from RGB-D data with Machine Learning algorithms. Here, we would like to investigate the usage of multi-modal sensors (camera, proximity, force/tactile, proprioception sensors) and human demonstrations for constructing a realistic kitchen environment.
