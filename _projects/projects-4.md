title: "Representing Robot Geometry as Distance Fields: Applications to Whole-body Manipulation"
excerpt: "This project represents a serial robot arms with Signed Distance Functions (SDF) with kinematic chain awareness. This differentiaable implicit representation enables efficient minimal distance and gradient query, which thus facilitate the design of dual-arm self-collision avoidance and whole-arm lifting big and bulky objects. I am mainly invovled in the dual-arm self-collision section."
