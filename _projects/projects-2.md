title: "Robot Learning to Move Like Animals: Sim2Real Transfer of DRL for Quadrupled Robots Learning Locomotion Gaits"
excerpt: "This project aims to reproduce the results presented in the paper titled **[Learning Agile Robotic Locomotion Skills by Imitating Animals](https://xbpeng.github.io/projects/Robotic_Imitation/2020_Robotic_Imitation.pdf)** on our self-designed multi-modal quadruped robot. I was involved in this project when I was doing my research internship at Tencent Robotics X Lab and my work mainly focus on the Sim2Real part. During my internship, I managed to transfer gaits learned in simulation to the real quadruped robot with a 100% success rate."
